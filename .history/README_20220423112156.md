# pgserials
use postgresql to process time serials data

The idea based on this blog:[Designing high-performance time series data tables on Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL](https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/database/designing-high-performance-time-series-data-tables-on-amazon-rds-for-postgresql/) 

## Code featuers

1. based on asyncio, it's asynchronous
2. only need PostgreSQL version hight than v9.5, dot't need any other plugins or extensions be installed
3. use partision table to handle huge data
4. based on sqlalchemy async core, can work in existing projects with no pain 


## install

    pip install pgserials

## init bucket

```python

BUCKET = Bucket('netspeed')

engine = create_async_engine(
        "postgresql+asyncpg://alexander:@127.0.0.1/brin_test", echo=True,
    )

async with get_conn() as conn:
    await Client(conn).regist_buckets(BUCKET).async_init()

```

pgserials create partition table ranged by time, it's default create partition table by month. async_init method create partition table current month, so you can use it immediately
